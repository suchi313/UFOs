# 👽 UFOs 👽

During the course of this project, we had to built and created a webpage using the following tools -JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap. We had imbed a filter within an HTML file that allowed the table to be fully dynamic (allowing users to react and add their inputs).

## Results 

The webpage includes five different filter search boxes. This helps our readers refine the data to filter UFO sightings based off **Date, City, State, Country, and State.**

## Summary 

The webpage is a very useful tool for Urogoloists to view data regards UFO sightings in mere seconds. 

### Recommendations
1. To provide a better picture for our readers, I would put a blurb above the filter search to help showcase the value of the filter search.

### Drawbacks
1. Filters being case sensitive 👎🏼
